    <h2>Milestone 2: Enhancement 1 - Software Design and Engineering</h2>

    <p>
      The artifact selected for this category’s (Software Design and Engineering) enhancement was <strong>AdvisingProgram.cpp</strong>. This was a C++ console app that I created when I took CS300. The program is basically a course catalog. It reads data from a CSV file, stores the data in a Binary Search Tree (BST), then allows you to list all courses or print certain courses to get information about those courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided that this artifact was a good choice because it has the potential to serve as a strong foundation for demonstrating my engineering and design practices. The enhancements I made in this milestone were improvements in modular class design (the program was split into multiple source and header files), robust input validation using regex and whitespace trimming, exception handling, defensive programming techniques, and the introduction of a reusable utility module (which handles the trimming).
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, I believe that the planned outcomes from Module One were met. The enhancements demonstrated my substantial progress toward the course outcome of using innovative techniques and tools in software engineering practices. The artifact also has a clean and maintainable design. Additionally, the artifact implements validated, secure, and user-friendly input processing. So far, there aren’t any updates needed to the outcome coverage plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      While performing the enhancements for this milestone, I have learned much more on how to better structure applications (not just C++) using a modular design pattern. I have also gained some experience with applying defensive coding techniques through improved exception handling and input validation. This increases the maintainability of the artifact. Through the process of trimming and validating input, I have improved data integrity. That, along with separating logic into well-defined classes and files, makes the project more scalable. One challenge I encountered was learning how to handle string validation using regex and understanding how file I/O exceptions behave in C++. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by researching best practices and testing.
